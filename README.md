### Developer Guide

- This repository holds the source code for
    - Playground docker image
    - Nginx based reverse proxy using SSL
    - Apt-Cacher-Ng
    - CI/CD configurations
- Playground
    - Dockerfile assembling slim-playground as an image is located at ```src/playground/slim/Dockerfile```, it is a minimal docker image with vs-code server installed
    - Dockerfile assembling dind-playground as an image is located at ```src/playground/dind/Dockerfile```, it is an extention of slim docker image with docker-in-docker support
    - It describes all the packages, configurations included in playground
- Apt-Cacher
    - ```src/assets/apt-cache``` defines an apt-cacher running in a docker-container
    - This acts as a caching proxy for playground and caches all packages that you install in playground so that you don't have to wait long to install it again
- Nginx reverse proxy
    - ```src/assets/reverse-proxy``` holds the nginx configuration file and the dockerfile
    - ```src/assets/reverse-proxy/docker-compose.yml``` create the reverse-proxy service and connect it with the playground over the playground network
    - Read about generating SSL certificates here at ```src/assets/reverse-proxy/nginx/certs/README.md```
- CI/CD
    - ```.travis.yml``` defines the CI/CD scripts for playground
    - CI builds are only triggered for master branch
